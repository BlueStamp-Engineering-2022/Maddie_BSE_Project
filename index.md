# Smart Mirror
A monitor behind a one-way mirror displays modules -- such as the weather, news headlines, and the time/date -- to viewers.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was uploading the code from another repository onto the Raspberry Pi. There are a lot of modules (eg. weather, US holidays, news headlines, time/date) were all added to ensure I had data to display instead of just a black screen. When I first ran the program, all the modules except the weather module loaded and had data. As I was trying to fix the weather module, I ran into a few issues such as it needing an API to get the weather data from openweathermap.com. However, I didn't have an API at the time so I went on a long journey to create an API and an API key. Once I obtained both, I changed the data in the configuration module from Seattle to San Francisco. Just having an API made the module work, and I was now able to get data from the website. The code in the Raspberry Pi modules gets data from other websites. For example, the module with news headlines gets those headlines from New York Times. I also talk a little about this and point out where the weather module is on the monitor in my video.
